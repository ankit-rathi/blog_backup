While you are learning Artificial Intelligence (AI) and looking to get into this exciting field, you may wonder which are the resources to refer, how do you know if a book or course is worth to spend time and/or money?

> Due to close association between Data Science (DS), Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), these terms have been used in this article interchangeably.

This is not an exhaustive list by any means, but it is good enough to keep as your reference. You can build your own list of references once you get more awareness of the field.

> You need not go through each and every resource mentioned here, I would suggest you build the foundation first using a course or a book and keep other resources for your reference.

### Books to refer

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*KsUJovlo19BEon_wIynWNg.png)

#### Machine Learning with R

This is an excellent book for the R starter who wants to apply ML to any kind of project. All the main ML models are presented, as well as different performance metrics, bagging, pruning, tuning, ensembling etc. Easy to scan through, many tips with fully-solved textbook problems. Certainly, a very good starting point if you plan to compete on Kaggle. If you already master both R and ML, this books is obviously not for you.

#### Python Machine Learning

This is a fantastic introductory book in machine learning with python. It provides enough background about the theory of each (covered) technique followed by its python code. One nice thing about the book is that it starts implementing Neural Networks from scratch, providing the reader with the chance of truly understanding the key underlying techniques such as back-propagation. Even further, the book presents an efficient (and professional) way of coding in python, the key to AI/ML.

#### ISLR

The book explains the concepts of Statistical Learning from the very beginning. The core ideas such as bias-variance trade-off are deeply discussed and revisited in many problems. The included R examples are particularly helpful for beginners to learn R. The book also provides a brief, but concise description of functions’ parameters for many related R packages. Compared to *The Elements of Statistical Learning*, it is easy for the reader to understand. It does a wonderful job of breaking things down complex concepts. If one wishes to learn more about a particular topic, I’d recommend The Element of Statistical Learning. These two pair nicely together.

#### Deep Learning

This is the book to read on deep learning. Written by luminaries in the field — if you’ve read any papers on deep learning, you must have heard about Goodfellow and Bengio before — and cutting through much of the BS surrounding the topic: like ‘big data’ before it, ‘deep learning’ is not something new and is not deserving of a special name. Networks with more hidden layers to detect higher-order features, networks of different types chained together in order to play to their strengths, graphs of networks to represent a probabilistic model.

This is a theoretical book, but it can be read in tandem with *Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow*, almost chapter-for-chapter. The Scikit-Learn and Tensorflow example code, while only moderately interesting on its own, helps to clarify the purpose of many of the topics in the Goodfellow book.

#### Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow

This book provides a great introduction to machine learning for both developer and non-developers. Authors suggest to just go through even if you don’t understand math details. Highlights of this book are:

-   Extraction of field expert knowledge is very important, you should know which model will serve better for the given solution. Luckily, a lot of models are available already from other scientists.
-   Training data is the most important part, the more you have it the better. So if you can you should accumulate as much data as you can, preferably categorized, you may not still know how you will apply the accumulated data in the future but you will need it.
-   Labelling training data is very important too, to train neural network you need to have at least thousands of labelled data samples, the more the better.
-   Machine learning algorithms and neural networks are pretty common for years but the latest breakthrough is possible because of new optimization, new autoencoders ( that may help to artificially generate training data) allowing to do training faster and with fewer data.
-   Machine learning is still pretty time and resources consuming process. To train a machine learning model you need to know how to tweak parameters and how to use different training approaches fitting the particular model.

The book demonstrates (including the code) different approaches using Scikit-Learn python package and also the TensorFlow.

#### Data Science for Business

This is probably the most practical book to read if you are looking for an overview of data science. Either you know when terms like k-means and ROC curves are to be used or you have some context when you start digging deeper into how some of these algorithms are implemented. You will find it at the right level because there is just enough math to explain the fundamental concepts and make them stick in your head.

This isn’t a book on implementing these concepts or a bunch of algorithms. This gives the book the advantage of being something you can refer to an intelligent manager or interested developer, and they can both get a lot out of it. And if they are interested in the next level of learning there are plenty of pointers. You will also find the chapter on presenting results through ROC curves, lift curves, etc. pretty interesting. It would be cool if this book had some more hands-on, but you can go to Kaggle and browse around the current and past competitions to apply what you learn here.

### Courses to attend

#### Machine Learning

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*kXMhOBDVRMz1Yw23eW5oSQ.png)

<https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning>

Machine Learning is one of the first programming MOOCs. Coursera put online by Coursera founder and Stanford Professor Andrew Ng. This course assumes that you have basic programming skills and you have some understanding of Linear Algebra. Knowledge of Statistics & Probability is not required though.

Andrew Ng does a good job explaining dense material and slides. The course gives you a lot of structure and direction for each homework, so it is generally pretty clear what you are supposed to do and how you are supposed to do it.

#### Deep Learning

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*B-YNpNbYhL7H3aV3FGJJhQ.png)

When you are rather new to the topic, you can learn a lot of doing the [deeplearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai/) specialization. First and foremost, you learn the basic concepts of NN. How does a forward pass in simple sequential models look like, what’s a backpropagation, and so on? I experienced this set of courses as a very time-effective way to learn the basics and worth more than all the tutorials, blog posts and talks, which I went through beforehand.

Doing this specialization is probably more than the first step into DL. I would say, each course is a single step in the right direction, so you end up with five steps in total. I think it builds a fundamental understanding of the field. But going further, you have to practice a lot and eventually it might be useful also to read more about the methodological background of DL variants. But doing the course work gets you started in a structured manner — which is worth a lot, especially in a field with so much buzz around it.

#### Essential Cheat Sheets for Machine Learning and Deep Learning Engineers

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*rJfSC9RVIKJS4GzizmMp2Q.png)

Machine learning is complex. For newbies, starting to learn machine learning can be painful if they don’t have the right resources to learn from. Most of the machine learning libraries are difficult to understand and the learning curve can be a bit frustrating. Kailash Ahirwar has created a repository on Github ([cheatsheets-ai](https://github.com/kailashahirwar/cheatsheets-ai)) containing cheatsheets for different machine learning frameworks, gathered from different sources. Have a look at the Github repository, also, contribute cheat sheets if you have any. Thanks.

#### HackerMath for Machine Learning

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*qOEVgyamB11p5sYwfhBcKg.png)

Math literacy, including proficiency in Linear Algebra and Statistics, is a must for anyone pursuing a career in data science. The goal of this workshop is to introduce some key concepts from these domains that get used repeatedly in data science/AI applications.

As outlined by Amit Kapoor, “Our approach is what we call the ‘Hacker’s way’. Instead of going back to formulae and proofs, we teach the concepts by writing code. And in practical applications. Concepts don’t remain sticky if the usage is never taught.”

The focus here is on depth rather than breadth. Three areas are chosen — Hypothesis Testing, Supervised Learning and Unsupervised Learning. They are covered to sufficient depth — 50% of the time on the concepts and 50% of the time spent coding them.
