title:  Data & AI Platforms — Open Source Vs Managed Services 
---

While designing and building Data & AI platforms, you may need to evaluate the options available. Whether your platform would be on-premise or you could use cloud/s services or you would take a hybrid approach.
In any case, you may need to look and evaluate various tools & services for your ingestion, storage, process/analysis and serving layers.
In this post, I have mapped open-source and popular managed cloud services to make our evaluation process a bit easier.
